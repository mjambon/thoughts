<h3 id="world">World<a name='world'/></h3>
<p>A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it directly or
indirectly. It is normally referred to as “the” world because it is
everything that exists from the subject’s perspective. An interaction
can be modeled as a flow of information, for some definition of
information to be specified. A world is isolated from everything else,
and therefore anything modeled within the world cannot learn anything
about the existence or the nature of other worlds.</p>
<h3 id="model">Model<a name='model'/></h3>
<p>An unambiguous representation of the <a href="#world">world</a>. As
such, a model can in principle, given sufficient technology, be
translated into another language and recovered back without loss. A
model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be
expressed. An example of a simple model is the representation of the sun
and the earth as points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, with the sun
being immobile and the earth rotating in a circular orbit over a
one-year period. Elementary mathematical knowledge is sufficient to read
and copy this model without mistakes. Our definition of a model includes
any arrangement of information that is believed to form a world model
but may not be accessed or copied in its entirety. For example, a human
body, mostly in its brain, holds world model, some of which was learned
by interacting with it since birth. While we may not have the technology
to copy correctly and completely the relevant information from a human
brain, we assume it’s all in there. Such world model that’s a necessary
part of any human mind shall not be confused with whatever explicit
models a thinker or scientist can construct and publish.</p>
