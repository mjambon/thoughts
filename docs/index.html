<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<div>
<a id='world'/>
</div>
<h3 id="world">World</h3>
<p>A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it directly or
indirectly. It is normally referred to as “the” world because it is
everything that exists from the subject’s perspective. An interaction
can be modeled as a flow of information, for some definition of
information to be specified. A world is isolated from everything else,
and therefore anything modeled within the world cannot learn anything
about the existence or the nature of other worlds.</p>
<div>
<a id='model'/>
</div>
<h3 id="model">Model</h3>
<p>An unambiguous representation of the <a href="#world">world</a>. As
such, a model can in principle, given sufficient technology, be
translated into another language and recovered back without loss. A
model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be
expressed. An example of a simple model is the representation of the sun
and the earth as points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, with the sun
being immobile and the earth rotating in a circular orbit over a
one-year period. Elementary mathematical knowledge is sufficient to read
and copy this model without mistakes. Our definition of a model includes
any arrangement of information that is believed to form a world model
but may not be accessed or copied in its entirety. For example, a human
body, mostly in its brain, holds world model, some of which was learned
by interacting with it since birth. While we may not have the technology
to copy correctly and completely the relevant information from a human
brain, we assume it’s all in there. Such world model that’s a necessary
part of any human mind shall not be confused with whatever explicit
models a thinker or scientist can construct and publish.</p>
<div>
<a id='time'/>
</div>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>An ordering over the states of a <a href="#model">model</a>. Time is
the breakdown of a model into a sequence of objects called states with
constraints over those states. A more specific definition of time is
part of each model, if the model relies on such notion of time or
successive states. Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of
computer programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t to reference the
successive steps of a computation. An ideal scenario is a computation of
discrete states starting from an initial state t = 0 and a transition
function. The transition function computes the next state from the
previous one. Such computations are called simulations. More generally
however, when there is no need for computing successive states, time is
usually modeled as the real line.</p>
<div>
<a id='system'/>
</div>
<h3 id="system">System</h3>
<p>A system refers to a partial <a href="#model">model</a>. It can be
obtained by taking some elements of a <a href="#world">world</a> model
and ignoring all interactions with the rest of the world, or by modeling
the rest of the world in a simpler manner than in the original model.
For example, modeling a car could consist in retaining a model of the
car components as well as a model of a road and how the car interacts
with the road, discarding all other elements of the world such as
buildings and trees. In this example, the car is the system and the road
is the rest of the world.</p>
<div>
<a id='environment'/>
</div>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>In a <a href="#model">model</a> comprising <a
href="#system">systems</a>, the environment refers to everything in the
model that’s not part of the system under consideration.</p>
<div>
<a id='sensing'/>
</div>
<h3 id="sensing">Sensing</h3>
<p>The acquisition of raw data by a <a href="#system">system</a> from
the <a href="#environment">environment</a>. This is usually done by
special-purpose parts of the system, which are called sensors.</p>
<div>
<a id='parameter'/>
</div>
<h3 id="parameter">Parameter</h3>
<p>A parameter of a <a href="#model">model</a> is any property of this
model that is left unspecified, defining a function in the usual
mathematical sense. In general, a model can have any number of
parameters.</p>
<div>
<a id='state'/>
</div>
<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>A particular instantiation of the <a href="#parameter">parameters</a>
of a <a href="#model">model</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='mutable'/>
</div>
<h3 id="mutable">Mutable</h3>
<p>An entity is said mutable when it consists of <a
href="#time">time</a>-indexed sequence of <a href="#state">states</a>.
Such sequence of states is meant to represent successive transformation
of an initial object within a model.</p>
<div>
<a id='individual'/>
</div>
<h3 id="individual">Individual</h3>
<p>In a <a href="#model">model</a> of the <a href="#world">world</a>, an
individual is a <a href="#mutable">mutable</a> <a
href="#system">system</a> which interacts with the rest of world,
including other individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous
period of <a href="#time">time</a>, usually in a binary fashion: at a
given time, the individual either exists or doesn’t exist.</p>
<div>
<a id='artificial'/>
</div>
<h3 id="artificial">Artificial</h3>
<p>The property of being created by <a
href="#individual">individuals</a>, as opposed to being imposed by the
<a href="#model">model</a> of the <a href="#world">world</a> in which
the individuals exist.</p>
<div>
<a id='identity'/>
</div>
<h3 id="identity">Identity</h3>
<p>The collection of properties associated with an <a
href="#individual">individual</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='set'/>
</div>
<h3 id="set">Set</h3>
<p>A set as defined in mathematics by the axioms of set theory.</p>
<div>
<a id='rule'/>
</div>
<h3 id="rule">Rule</h3>
<p>An <a href="#artificial">artificial</a> constraint. Unlike a physical
constraint which can apply to various portions of a <a
href="#model">model</a>, an artificial constraint applies to <a
href="#individual">individual</a> members of a society, and said members
can decide whether to follow it.</p>
<div>
<a id='society'/>
</div>
<h3 id="society">Society</h3>
<p>A <a href="#set">set</a> of <a href="#individual">individuals</a>
known as society members within a <a href="#model">model</a> of the <a
href="#world">world</a>, and associated with <a
href="#rule">rules</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='nature'/>
</div>
<h3 id="nature">Nature</h3>
<p>A model of the world without a <a href="#society">society</a>.</p>
<pre><code>- natural</code></pre>
<div>
<a id='tool'/>
</div>
<h3 id="tool">Tool</h3>
<p>A tool, in the very general sense that interests us, is an extension
of what’s normally considered the body of an individual and facilitates
their interaction with the <a href="#environment">environment</a>. This
definition includes all machines, methods, and processes stored outside
of the normal body of an individual. In the usual human world, this
includes not just physical devices such as a hammer or a computer, but
also all data stored outside the body such as books and other
recordings. Therefore, other individuals can also be considered as tools
according this definition.</p>
<div>
<a id='activity'/>
</div>
<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>
<p>Collection of events involving <a href="#individual">individuals</a>
using specific <a href="#tool">tools</a> or methods.</p>
<div>
<a id='science'/>
</div>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>The <a href="#activity">activity</a> consisting in creating and
refining <a href="#model">models</a> of the <a
href="#world">world</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='creation'/>
</div>
<h3 id="creation">Creation</h3>
<p><a href="#activity">Activity</a> whose impact on the <a
href="#world">world</a> is noticed and becomes associated with a new
concept, in some <a href="#model">model</a> of interest.</p>
<div>
<a id='engineering'/>
</div>
<h3 id="engineering">Engineering</h3>
<p>The <a href="#activity">activity</a> of <a
href="#creation">creating</a> <a href="#tool">tools</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='art'/>
</div>
<h3 id="art">Art</h3>
<p>The <a href="#activity">activity</a> of <a
href="#creation">creating</a> anything that is not a <a
href="#tool">tool</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='mathematics'/>
</div>
<h3 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h3>
<p>The study of the structure of unambiguous statements. Mathematics are
useful for dealing with <a href="#model">models</a> in <a
href="#science">science</a>, <a href="#engineering">engineering</a>, and
other fields of study.</p>
<div>
<a id='computer'/>
</div>
<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>
<p>A finite <a href="#system">system</a> that reads discrete
instructions and carries them out predictably. A computer can be <a
href="#model">represented</a> as a sequence of <a
href="#state">states</a> comprising a <a href="#mutable">mutable</a>,
discrete storage space. Turing machines are idealized representations of
computers with unbounded storage or memory; they are used in theoretical
studies for proving some properties of computers. This definition
excludes hypercomputers, which would allow solving problems that Turing
machines cannot, such as the halting problem.</p>
<div>
<a id='logic'/>
</div>
<h3 id="logic">Logic</h3>
<p>The <a href="#mathematics">mathematical</a> subfield of logic. It is
focused on the general properties of formal systems and characterizing
what can and cannot be done with mathematics and <a
href="#computer">computers</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='computation'/>
</div>
<h3 id="computation">Computation</h3>
<p>The <a href="#time">successive</a> <a href="#state">states</a> of a
<a href="#computer">computer</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='program'/>
</div>
<h3 id="program">Program</h3>
<p>A computer program in the usual sense. A program consists of a finite
collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer or by a
Turing machine. A program may or may not take external input. In
theoretical studies, the input is often baked into the program or into
the initial state of the computer’s memory. A program may or not
terminate. Determining whether a program terminates is not always
possible, which is known as the halting problem. A program can be viewed
as a mathematical proof and vice-versa, which is known as the
Curry-Howard correspondence, and offers a link between <a
href="#logic">logic</a> and <a href="#computation">computation</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='algorithm'/>
</div>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>An algorithm is a <a href="#program">program</a> that terminates.</p>
<div>
<a id='action'/>
</div>
<h3 id="action">Action</h3>
<p>A change in two <a href="#time">successive</a> <a
href="#state">states</a> of a <a href="#system">system</a> that
determines a change elsewhere in the <a href="#world">world</a> <a
href="#model">model</a>, possibly in the system itself.</p>
<div>
<a id='decision'/>
</div>
<h3 id="decision">Decision</h3>
<p>An <a href="#action">action</a> of a <a href="#system">system</a>
onto itself, in particular when examining a small selection of possible
actions that are mutually exclusive.</p>
<div>
<a id='mind'/>
</div>
<h3 id="mind">Mind</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The components of a <a href="#system">system</a> that make it more
durable independently from its other properties. This tentative
definition is meant to incorporate the dualist notion that the mind is
separate from the rest of the body and somewhat optional, while
emphasizing that it’s only a simplified model useful for studying <a
href="#decision">decision</a> <a href="#computation">processes</a>.</li>
<li>A self-improving <a href="#world">world</a> <a
href="#model">model</a>. In this equivalent view, the mind continuously
gathers information about the <a href="#environment">environment</a>
around the system and uses it to make better decisions.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<a id='cognition'/>
</div>
<h3 id="cognition">Cognition</h3>
<p>The properties of a <a href="#mind">mind</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='concept'/>
</div>
<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<p>A binary state within a <a href="#mind">mind</a>. A concept is
generally considered to be turned on or off by the activity of the mind,
including other concepts.</p>
<div>
<a id='abstract'/>
</div>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>A <a href="#concept">concept</a> is said more abstract than another
when its full definition from elementary concepts is more complex.</p>
<div>
<a id='concrete'/>
</div>
<h3 id="concrete">Concrete</h3>
<p>The opposite of <a href="#abstract">abstract</a>. A <a
href="#concept">concept</a> is more concrete than another when it is
less abstract. In a <a href="#mind">mind</a>, the most concrete concepts
are the <a href="#state">states</a> of <a
href="#sensing">sensors</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='intuition'/>
</div>
<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>The activation of <a href="#abstract">abstract</a> <a
href="#concept">concepts</a> or ideas within a <a
href="#mind">mind</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='perception'/>
</div>
<h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
<p>A form of <a href="#intuition">intuition</a> involving <a
href="#concept">concepts</a> that form a <a href="#model">model</a> of
the <a href="#world">world</a> as it is being <a
href="#sensing">sensed</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='reaction'/>
</div>
<h3 id="reaction">Reaction</h3>
<p>An <a href="#action">action</a> that is triggered within a <a
href="#mind">mind</a> by the presence of a particular <a
href="#concept">concept</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='optimization'/>
</div>
<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>
<p>An activity consisting in modifying a <a href="#system">system</a> so
as to increase its fitness, which is a number, specifically an element
taken from an ordered set. The goal function, objective function or
fitness function is the function that maps a <a href="#state">state</a>
of a system to the number referred to as fitness.</p>
<div>
<a id='feedback'/>
</div>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Input of the <a href="#optimization">fitness</a> function of a <a
href="#system">system</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='symbol'/>
</div>
<h3 id="symbol">Symbol</h3>
<p>A conventional representation of a <a href="#concept">concept</a>. It
is a component of the <a href="#world">world</a> to which some members
of a <a href="#society">society</a> will <a href="#reaction">react</a>
in a similar manner and that does not provide <a
href="#optimization">benefits</a> other than eliciting similar reactions
in others. A special case of a symbol is one that’s used only by a
single <a href="#individual">individual</a>. It suffices that the
concept be identified as such by the individual to be considered a
symbol. For example, “that feeling when I do X” shall be considered an
internal symbol because it’s a concept whose presence is clearly
identified by the subject. The subject might then try to reproduce it
with the aim of eliciting a particular <a href="#reaction">reaction</a>
in their own <a href="#mind">mind</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='reasoning'/>
</div>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>Any <a href="#mind">mental</a> activity that makes heavy use of <a
href="#symbol">symbols</a>.</p>
<div>
<a id='sentence'/>
</div>
<h3 id="sentence">Sentence</h3>
<p>A sentence is a compound <a href="#symbol">symbol</a> i.e. a symbol
formed by combining multiple symbols into one.</p>
<div>
<a id='language'/>
</div>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>A collection of <a href="#symbol">symbols</a> produced by combining
other symbols. A combination of symbols that itself forms a symbol is
referred to as a <a href="#sentence">compound symbol</a> or a <a
href="#sentence">sentence</a>. One shall distinguish formal languages
from informal languages.</p>

<h3 id="informal-language">Informal Language</h3>
<p>An informal language is a <a href="#language">language</a> made of
ambiguous <a href="#symbol">symbols</a>. A simple symbol or a <a
href="#sentence">compound symbol</a> is ambiguous if it elicits
different <a href="#reaction">reactions</a> in different people. For
example, a simple English sentence like “the sky is blue” is ambiguous
at least because different people have different notions of the color
blue or whether this claim asserts that the sky is always blue. The
missing details are usually called “context” but for an informal
language, it is not possible to provide all the context for a <a
href="#sentence">sentence</a> to become unambiguous. What prevents this
is how each <a href="#mind">mind</a> produces <a
href="#concept">concepts</a> and reacts to them as a function of its own
state rather than just as a function of new external data.</p>

<a id='formal-language'/>
</div>
<h3 id="formal-language">Formal Language</h3>
<p>A formal language is a <a href="#language">language</a> defined
mathematically, or equivalently unambiguously. Most programming
languages can be thought of as formal languages, even if in practice
certain aspects of the language are left undefined. Another example of
“almost formal” languages are mathematical proofs. While ordinary
mathematical proofs are expressed in a natural language such as English,
they are believed to be translatable into one or more equivalent
proof-checking <a href="#algorithm">algorithms</a> by different people.
Since not everyone understands a given mathematical proof, the key is to
convince the audience that they understand the proof only if they really
do. As a shortcut, we might therefore allow ourselves to treat most
mathematical discourse as using a formal language. This contrasts with
everyday <a href="#informal-language">informal languages</a>, which are
not believed nor designed to be unambiguous.</p>

<h3 id="imagination">Imagination</h3>
<p>A form of <a href="#intuition">intuition</a>, generally involving <a

already exist.</p>
<div>
<a id='implicit-model'/>
</div>
<h3 id="implicit-model">Implicit Model</h3>
<p>A <a href="#model">model</a> implemented by a <a
href="#mind">mind</a>. A mind makes <a href="#decision">decisions</a> at
least partially by relying on some internal structure in the <a
href="#system">system</a>, without relying on a <a
href="#symbol">symbolism</a> or language that makes it transferable to
other <a href="#individual">individuals</a>. This internal structure is
considered an implicit world model.</p>
<div>
<a id='explicit-model'/>
</div>
<h3 id="explicit-model">Explicit Model</h3>
<p>A <a href="#model">model</a> transferable by a <a
href="#system">system</a> to another system using <a
href="#symbol">symbols</a> forming a language.</p>
<div>
<a id='understanding'/>

<h3 id="understanding">Understanding</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some measure of how much a <a href="#mind">mind</a> reproduces <a
href="#implicit-model">implicitly</a> the essential features of some
external <a href="#model">model</a>. It can be tested by placing the
mind in an <a href="#environment">environment</a> that requires quick <a
href="#decision">decisions</a> that benefit from identifying features of
the model without much <a href="#computation">computation</a>.</li>
<li>The properties of a mind that allow it to extend its implicit <a
href="#world">world</a> model.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<a id='communication'/>
</div>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Transfer of <a href="#concept">concepts</a> from an <a
href="#individual">individual</a> to other individuals. A concept is the
activation of a construct within a particular <a href="#mind">mind</a>.
In general and ideally, two individuals with similar experience and
exposed to the same input will activate approximately equivalent
concepts. For example, when seeing an apple, some kind of neuron may
light up, corresponding to the approximately defined concept of “an
apple being present in front of them”. We distinguish concepts, which
are internal to each mind, from <a href="#symbol">symbols</a> which are
placeholders meant to activate, trigger, or elicit a particular concept.
Communication may or may not rely on symbols. <a
href="#language">Language</a> relies on symbols to represent concepts.
An example of communication without symbols is teaching by example, such
as an animal showing their offspring how to catch prey by just doing
it.</p>
<div>
<a id='taboo'/>
</div>
<h3 id="taboo">Taboo</h3>
<p>A <a href="#concept">concept</a> that is being avoided by one or more
<a href="#individual">individuals</a>. Keeping in mind that a concept is
the activation of a particular state of the <a href="#mind">mind</a>,
avoiding a concept is a complex process. It takes the mind some training
that consists in identifying situations that may lead to the concept,
and favoring <a href="#decision">decisions</a> that take the focus away
from the taboo concept. It is important to distinguish a taboo from any
undesirable situation. A taboo concept is not just about avoiding a
specific situation but also avoiding thinking about it. For example, the
concept “a tiger is attacking me” for most people is not taboo because
we don’t have a problem imagining this. The actual concept that we want
to avoid is “the tiger is attacking me right now for real”. A taboo is a
concept that is completely avoided, possibly due to threats <a
href="#communication">communicated</a> by others or more generally due
to fear caused by <a href="#feedback">negative</a> past experience
involving co-occurring concepts.</p>
