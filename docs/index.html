<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>This a collection of definitions that are important to us. They’re listed such that no term is referenced before its definition. This guarantees no circular definitions.</p>
<div>
<a id='world'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-world"><a href='#world' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> world</h3>
<p>A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it directly or indirectly. It is normally referred to as “the” world because it is everything that exists from the subject’s perspective. An interaction can be modeled as a flow of information, for some definition of information to be specified. A world is isolated from everything else, and therefore anything modeled within the world cannot learn anything about the existence or the nature of other worlds.</p>
<div>
<a id='mathematics'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-mathematics"><a href='#mathematics' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> mathematics</h3>
<p>The study of unambiguous statements, or equivalently, the study of structure.</p>
<p>What distinguishes a mathematical statement from an ordinary English sentence is that a mathematical statement is interpreted in the same way by all mathematicians at minimal effort and regardless of their beliefs about the world. A statement can only be proven from ground truths known as axioms, from other proven statements, and using a fixed set of symbols and rules that allow combining statements into new statements. A proven statement is known as a theorem. Proving a statement can be very hard. Some statements are easy to prove with a 20th-century computer and software while being tedious to prove by humans. Such proofs are generally referred to as computations. Other statements were proven by humans but could not yet proven by computers as of the beginning of the 21st century. Some statements cannot even be proven at all and are referred to as being undecidable. The relationship between proofs and computation, as well as their fundamental limitations are now well-understood. A basic understanding of these notions is considered a prerequisite in the rest of this book.</p>
<div>
<a id='model'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-model"><a href='#model' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> model</h3>
<p>An unambiguous representation of the <a href="#world">world</a>.</p>
<p>As such, a model can in principle, given sufficient technology, be translated into another language and recovered back without loss. A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be expressed. An example of a simple model is the representation of the sun and the earth as points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, with the sun being immobile and the earth rotating in a circular orbit over a one-year period. Elementary <a href="#mathematics">mathematical</a> knowledge is sufficient to read and copy this model without mistakes. Our definition of a model includes any arrangement of information that is believed to form a world model but may not be accessed or copied in its entirety. For example, a human body, mostly in its brain, holds a world model, some of which was learned by interacting with the world since birth. While we may not have the technology to copy correctly and completely the relevant information from a human brain, we assume it’s all in there. Such a world model that’s a necessary part of any human mind shall not be confused with whatever explicit models a thinker or scientist can construct and publish.</p>
<p>Important remarks that will be developed later:</p>
<ul>
<li>A model of the world in which we exist is necessarily imperfect.</li>
<li>In practice, models are usually parametrized by numbers or other objects. Technically, changing a parameter produces a different model. When the context is clear, we might refer to a parametrized model simply as “a model” even though it is a collection of models.</li>
<li>A model supports simulations. A simulation is a computation that discovers new facts about the model. It is meant to predict features of the world it represents.</li>
<li>Some properties of a model can be verified or challenged by observations and experiments i.e. interactions with the world that produce data.</li>
<li>Scientific research is about creating and refining world models that are compatible with observations.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<a id='time'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-time"><a href='#time' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> time</h3>
<p>An ordering over the states of a <a href="#model">model</a>. Time is the breakdown of a model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints over those states. A more specific definition of time is part of each model, if the model relies on such notion of time or successive states. Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t to reference the successive steps of a computation. An ideal scenario is a computation of discrete states starting from an initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The transition function computes the next state from the previous one. Such computations are called simulations. More generally however, when there is no need for computing successive states, time is usually modeled as the real line.</p>
<div>
<a id='system'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-system"><a href='#system' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> system</h3>
<p>A system refers to a partial <a href="#model">model</a>. It can be obtained by taking some elements of a <a href="#world">world</a> model and ignoring all interactions with the rest of the world, or by modeling the rest of the world in a simpler manner than in the original model. For example, modeling a car could consist in retaining a model of the car components as well as a model of a road and how the car interacts with the road, discarding all other elements of the world such as buildings and trees. In this example, the car is the system and the road is the rest of the world.</p>
<div>
<a id='environment'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-environment"><a href='#environment' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> environment</h3>
<p>In a <a href="#model">model</a> comprising <a href="#system">systems</a>, the environment refers to everything in the model that’s not part of the system under consideration.</p>
<div>
<a id='sensing'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-sensing"><a href='#sensing' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> sensing</h3>
<p>The acquisition of raw data by a <a href="#system">system</a> from the <a href="#environment">environment</a>. This is usually done by special-purpose parts of the system, which are called sensors.</p>
<div>
<a id='parameter'/>

<h3 id="def-parameter"><a href='#parameter' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> parameter</h3>
<p>A parameter of a <a href="#model">model</a> is any property of this model that is left unspecified, defining a function in the usual <a href="#mathematics">mathematical</a> sense. In general, a model can have any number of parameters.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="def-mutable"><a href='#mutable' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> mutable</h3>
<p>An entity is said mutable when it consists of <a href="#time">time</a>-indexed sequence of <a href="#state">states</a>. Such sequence of states is meant to represent successive transformation of an initial object within a model.</p>
<div>
<a id='individual'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-individual"><a href='#individual' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> individual</h3>
<p>In a <a href="#model">model</a> of the <a href="#world">world</a>, an individual is a <a href="#mutable">mutable</a> <a href="#system">system</a> which interacts with the rest of world, including other individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous period of <a href="#time">time</a>, usually in a binary fashion: at a given time, the individual either exists or doesn’t exist.</p>
<div>
<a id='artificial'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-artificial"><a href='#artificial' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> artificial</h3>

<p>An <a href="#artificial">artificial</a> constraint. Unlike a physical constraint which can apply to various portions of a <a href="#model">model</a>, an artificial constraint applies to <a href="#individual">individual</a> members of a society, and said members can decide whether to follow it.</p>

<p>A tool, in the very general sense that interests us, is an extension of what’s normally considered the body of an individual and facilitates their interaction with the <a href="#environment">environment</a>. This definition includes all machines, methods, and processes stored outside of the normal body of an individual. In the usual human world, this includes not just physical devices such as a hammer or a computer, but also all data stored outside the body such as books and other recordings. Therefore, other individuals can also be considered as tools according this definition.</p>

<p>A finite <a href="#system">system</a> that reads discrete instructions and carries them out predictably. A computer can be <a href="#model">represented</a> as a sequence of <a href="#state">states</a> comprising a <a href="#mutable">mutable</a>, discrete storage space. Turing machines are idealized representations of computers with unbounded storage or memory; they are used in theoretical studies for proving some properties of computers. This definition excludes hypercomputers, which would allow solving problems that Turing machines cannot, such as the halting problem.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="def-program"><a href='#program' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> program</h3>
<p>A computer program in the usual sense. A program consists of a finite collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer or by a Turing machine. A program may or may not take external input. In theoretical studies, the input is often baked into the program or into the initial state of the computer’s memory. A program may or not terminate. Determining whether a program terminates is not always possible, which is known as the halting problem. A program can be viewed as a mathematical proof and vice-versa, which is known as the Curry-Howard correspondence, and offers a link between <a href="#logic">logic</a> and <a href="#computation">computation</a>.</p>

A special case of a symbol is one that’s used only by a single <a href="#individual">individual</a>. It suffices that the concept be identified as such by the individual to be considered a symbol. For example, “that feeling when I do X” shall be considered an internal symbol because it’s a concept whose presence is clearly identified by the subject.

A combination of symbols that itself forms a symbol is referred to as a <a href="#sentence">compound symbol</a> or a <a href="#sentence">sentence</a>. One shall distinguish formal languages from informal languages.</p>

<h3 id="def-informal-language"><a href='#informal-language' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> informal language</h3>
<p>An informal language is a <a href="#language">language</a> made of ambiguous <a href="#symbol">symbols</a>. A simple symbol or a <a href="#sentence">compound symbol</a> is ambiguous if it elicits different <a href="#reaction">reactions</a> in different people. For example, a simple English sentence like “the sky is blue” is ambiguous at least because different people have different notions of the color blue or whether this claim asserts that the sky is always blue. The missing details are usually called “context” but for an informal language, it is not possible to provide all the context for a <a href="#sentence">sentence</a> to become unambiguous. What prevents this is how each <a href="#mind">mind</a> produces <a href="#concept">concepts</a> and reacts to them as a function of its own state rather than just as a function of new external data.</p>

<p>A formal language is a <a href="#language">language</a> defined mathematically, or equivalently unambiguously. Most programming languages can be thought of as formal languages, even if in practice certain aspects of the language are left undefined. Another example of “almost formal” languages are mathematical proofs. While ordinary mathematical proofs are expressed in a natural language such as English, they are believed to be translatable into one or more equivalent proof-checking <a href="#algorithm">algorithms</a> by different people. Since not everyone understands a given mathematical proof, the key is to convince the audience that they understand the proof only if they really do. As a shortcut, we might therefore allow ourselves to treat most mathematical discourse as using a formal language. This contrasts with everyday <a href="#informal-language">informal languages</a>, which are not believed nor designed to be unambiguous.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="def-implicit-model"><a href='#implicit-model' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> implicit model</h3>
<p>A <a href="#model">model</a> implemented by a <a href="#mind">mind</a>. A mind makes <a href="#decision">decisions</a> at least partially by relying on some internal structure in the <a href="#system">system</a>, without relying on a <a href="#symbol">symbolism</a> or language that makes it transferable to other <a href="#individual">individuals</a>. This internal structure is considered an implicit world model.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Some measure of how much a <a href="#mind">mind</a> reproduces <a href="#implicit-model">implicitly</a> the essential features of some external <a href="#model">model</a>. It can be tested by placing the mind in an <a href="#environment">environment</a> that requires quick <a href="#decision">decisions</a> that benefit from identifying features of the model without much <a href="#computation">computation</a>.</li>

<a id='communication'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-communication"><a href='#communication' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> communication</h3>
<p>Transfer of <a href="#concept">concepts</a> from an <a href="#individual">individual</a> to other individuals. A concept is the activation of a construct within a particular <a href="#mind">mind</a>. In general and ideally, two individuals with similar experience and exposed to the same input will activate approximately equivalent concepts. For example, when seeing an apple, some kind of neuron may light up, corresponding to the approximately defined concept of “an apple being present in front of them”. We distinguish concepts, which are internal to each mind, from <a href="#symbol">symbols</a> which are placeholders meant to activate, trigger, or elicit a particular concept. Communication may or may not rely on symbols. <a href="#language">Language</a> relies on symbols to represent concepts. An example of communication without symbols is teaching by example, such as an animal showing their offspring how to catch prey by just doing it.</p>

<a id='taboo'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-taboo"><a href='#taboo' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> taboo</h3>
<p>A <a href="#concept">concept</a> that is being avoided by one or more <a href="#individual">individuals</a>. Keeping in mind that a concept is the activation of a particular state of the <a href="#mind">mind</a>, avoiding a concept is a complex process. It takes the mind some training that consists in identifying situations that may lead to the concept, and favoring <a href="#decision">decisions</a> that take the focus away from the taboo concept. It is important to distinguish a taboo from any undesirable situation. A taboo concept is not just about avoiding a specific situation but also avoiding thinking about it. For example, the concept “a tiger is attacking me” for most people is not taboo because we don’t have a problem imagining this. The actual concept that we want to avoid is “the tiger is attacking me right now for real”. A taboo is a concept that is completely avoided, possibly due to threats <a href="#communication">communicated</a> by others or more generally due to fear caused by <a href="#feedback">negative</a> past experience involving co-occurring concepts.</p>

<h3 id="def-coincidence"><a href='#coincidence' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> coincidence</h3>
<p>The correct prediction of a <a href="#temporal-data-point">temporal data point</a> by chance.</p>
<p>If a <a href="#model">model</a> predicts a value or a range of values for an <a href="#event">event</a> and it turns out to match the <a href="#temporal-data-point">temporal data point</a>, it does not necessarily validate the model. If the model is shown to not predict other data points and is therefore invalid, an observation that is predicted by the model is said to be a coincidence.</p>

<a id='causality'/>
</div>
<h3 id="def-causality"><a href='#causality' style='font-weight:normal; color: grey'>#</a> <span class="def-prefix">def</span> causality</h3>
<p>Causality is a feature of some <a href="#model">models</a> that include a notion of <a href="#time">time</a>. Such a model can be reduced to a small number of time-dependent variables (causes) that are sufficient to predict a future <a href="#state">state</a> of another variable (effect) with acceptable accuracy.</p>
<p>In general, causality changes as a model is refined. Some variables that used to be the cause for an effect are no longer considered causes while new variables become causes. Changes in causality can occur without significant changes in the model’s accuracy for predicting various variables, including those variables assigned to causes and effects.</p>
<p>Causality is therefore not necessary for a <a href="#world">world</a> model to be predictive. Causality is also not robust to improvements of a model in which new variables are introduced and others are retired. In practice, it’s more useful in engineering than in science where artificial systems are designed to maintain familiar cause-effect relations rather than causality being inferred from nature.</p>
