title: Where Is My Mind?
draft: true

a common model: humans, other animals, and possibly robots, aliens,
etc. are equipped with a system for perceiving and reacting to their
environment called a mind. A mind is unique to each individual,
unambiguously enclosed within a physical container such as a skull,
and there's no confusion between a person's mind and another person's
mind.

applicability of this model:
- when communication is achieved mostly via language
- stable, agreed-upon interfaces

when this model can become questionable:
- physical coupling: siamese twins, twins, mother carrying infant,
  close teamwork
- physical uncertainty: artificial mind that can be copied into another
  physical host, two artificial minds that are the result of a copy, distributed
  mind, telepathically connected brains via high-bandwidth electronic
  implants
- physical overlap: a hypothetical tiny intelligent organism
  living in the brain of a larger creature
- partial minds: borg individuals that are temporarily disconnected
  from the hive (Star Trek), multiple personality disorders where
  multiple areas of the brain have their own identity but share other areas
