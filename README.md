# Thoughts

This a collection of thoughts on various topics. This book is made of a
collection of articles that fall into one of these four kinds:

* Definitions: definitions are given for a collection of the main
  concepts described in the book. They are disambiguations or
  specializations of otherwise ordinary English terms.
  Definitions are made as unambiguous as possible and
  organized so as to avoid cyclic definitions. A definition may only
  refer to previous definitions and no other kind of article. Priority
  is given to correctness over an ease of understanding. Minimal examples
  are provided with this goal in mind.
* Tutorials: a tutorial is a progressive introduction to a topic. It
  can reference freely other parts of the book.
* Case studies: a case study looks into a particular problem and
  solves it using the concepts introduced in this book.
* Discussions: a discussion looks into choices made in this book,
  compares it to some other approaches, and attempts to justify the
  choices made in the book.
